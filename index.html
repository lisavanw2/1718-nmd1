        <p>Here are some things I was realy proud of in my first year of Graphic Media Design. I was always very excited of making them and had a lot of fun. But sometimes, I was also a bit frustrated</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.</p>
        <div class="over_mezelf">
            <h2 id="over_mezelf">About me</h2>
            <p>Some general facts about myself:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                <li>I was born on the 23<sup>th</sup> of April in 1997</li>
                <li>My hometown is Lokeren (and I love it)</li>
                <li>I like spending time with my <strong>family</strong></li>
                <li>I really care about the wellbeing of my nails (really they are <strong>superimportant</strong> to me)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A few years ago, I started my higher education with the thought that I wanted to be a programmer. Unfortunately, I realized that I was missing something, I wasn't as happy as I would have liked and my motivation to complete my education was dropping <strong>fast</strong>. So I began thinking why this was the case, I quickly realized I needed to be able to express myself. So my search began to find something where I could do exactly that.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="later">
            <h2 id="later">My future</h2>
            <p>I don't have my whole futere planned yet, and I don't think I ever will. That's part of the <strong>fun</strong>. I am very hopeful that I will find a job I will love for the rest of my carrier I just hope that everything works out.</p>
