            <p id="introPort">Here are some things I was realy proud of in my first year of Graphic Media Design. I was always very excited of making them and had a lot of fun. But sometimes, I was also a bit frustrated. Which is normal because I always want to get it right, even if that means starting over and over again.</p>
            <p id='introPort'>I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.</p>
            <div id="opdracht"> <img src="afbeeldingen/compositie.png" id="compositie" />
                <p id="omschrijving">This was my very first assignment, we needed to make a good looking composition with only a couple of shapes and one accent colour. After some trial and error, I came up with this shape that looked a little bit like a bird. I turned it in different directions and made the composition you see here. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="opdracht"><img src="afbeeldingen/stad.png" id="stad" />
                <p id="omschrijving">This is a city, made in an isometric grid. I choose to keep it simple, with only a couple of colours. This way, it had the industrial look I was going for. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="opdracht"> <img src="afbeeldingen/logo.png" id="logo" />
                <p id="omschrijving">With this assignment, I discovered my first real problem. I don't like to use existing fonts, and unfortunately for me, we were meant to use them. I didn't think it was so important so I created my own. As a result, the teachers found it to complex so I remade it and this was the result.</p>

            <div id="opdracht"> <img src="afbeeldingen/antarcticaLandschap.jpg" id="foto" />
                <img src="afbeeldingen/landschap.png" id="landschap" />
                <p id="omschrijving">This was my absolute favorite assignment of the semester. We had to stylize a landscape, using any shapes or forms we like. I chose this Arctic landscape with a few penguins and turned it into this. I really liked the outcome although I had some difficulties to choose the right blues.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="opdracht"><img src="afbeeldingen/poster.png" id="poster" />
                <p id="omschrijving">As assignment for our exam, we had to make a poster for a fictive event. We even had to come up with a title and incorporate a picture of something that had to do with interiordesign. I eventually went for a very minimalistic kitchen with red and black.</p>

                <p id="ssdOmschrijving">I've recently had the pleasure to design some new icons for the rebranding of the Social Service of the Belgium police (SSD).It thaught me that nothing is as good as you initially think. After looking at them again and again, I had a lot of versions to show them so they could vote which one they wanted. The three you see here, are the ones that they are actually using.</p>

        <div class="about_me">
            <h2 id="about_me">About me</h2>
            <p>Some general facts about myself:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                <li>I was born on the 23<sup>th</sup> of April in 1997</li>
                <li>My hometown is Lokeren (and I love it) but I was actually born in Ghent</li>
                <li>I like spending time with my <strong>family</strong> and going on little trips with them</li>
                <li>I really care about the wellbeing of my nails (really they are <strong>superimportant</strong> to me) because I like to do some nail art from time to time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In High-school I studied applied sciences and modern languages. I liked it very much and learned a lot of useful (and not so useful) stuff. Everyone thought that I would become a scientist or a translater or something because that was in line with my education. <em>(They were in for quite the surprise.)</em> A few years ago, I started my higher education with the thought that I wanted to be a programmer. <br/> Unfortunately, I realized that I was missing something, I wasn't as happy as I would have liked and my motivation to complete my education was dropping <strong>fast</strong>. So I began thinking why this was the case, I quickly realized I needed to be able to express myself. So my search began to find something where I could do exactly that.</p>
            <p>Here, in Graphic and Digital Media, I found what I was looking for. I can express myself and made a lot of good friends. I hope I will achieve my diploma in 2 years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="future">
            <h2 id="future">My future</h2>
            <p>I don't have my whole future planned yet, and I don't think I ever will. That's part of the <strong>fun</strong>. I am very hopeful that I will find a job I will love until I have to retire. I just hope that everything works out and that I have a lot of fun while working.</p>
